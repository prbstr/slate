# Introduction

Welcome to the Hush API! You can use our API to access Hush API endpoints, which can get information on around live radio streams, catch up clips and podcasts.

# Authentication

Hush expects the id token to be included in most API requests to the server in an Authorization header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: Bearer token`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace "token" with the token received from Firebase authentication.
</aside>

# Preferences

## Music and podcast preferences

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/preference"
  -X GET 
```

```json
  [{"id":1,"type":1,"title":"News"},
  {"id":2,"type":1,"title":"Sport"},
  {"id":3,"type":2,"title":"Soul"},
  {"id":4,"type":2,"title":"80s"},
  {"id":5,"type":2,"title":"African"},
  {"id":6,"type":2,"title":"Blues"}]
```

```shell
